## Running the webapp
Either manually set `FLASK_APP` and `FLASK_ENV` manually (instructions [here](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/factory/#run-the-application)) or run `run-app.sh`. You should see the following output:

```
$ ./run-app.sh
> * Serving Flask app "src/webapp" (lazy loading)
> * Environment: development
> * Debug mode: on
> * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
> * Restarting with stat
> * Debugger is active!
> * Debugger PIN: 211-961-312
```

Then visit `localhost:5000/` / `127.0.0.1:5000/` to see the webapp in action.
